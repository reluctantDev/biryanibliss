### 📱 Required Actions in Xcode

#### Step 1: Clean and Rebuild

2. **Product → Clean Build Folder** (⌘+Shift+K)
3. **Build the project** (⌘+B)

#### Step 2: Verify Icon Integration
1. **Navigate to Assets.xcassets** in Xcode
2. **Click on AppIcon** to open the icon set
3. **Verify all slots are filled** with the correct icons
4. **Check that the 60pt @2x slot** shows the 120x120 icon

#### Step 3: Archive and Validate
1. **Product → Archive** to create a build
2. **Distribute App → App Store Connect**
3. **Validate the app** to check for remaining issues

### 🎯 Specific Validation Fix

The error mentioned:
> "Missing required icon file. The bundle does not contain an app icon for iPhone / iPod Touch of exactly '120x120' pixels"

**Fixed by**:
- ✅ **AppIcon-60x60@2x.png** (120x120) - Primary iPhone app icon
- ✅ **Icon-120.png** (120x120) - Additional compatibility icon
- ✅ **Proper Contents.json** - Correct metadata for Xcode

### 🔍 Troubleshooting Steps

#### If Validation Still Fails:

1. **Check Xcode Asset Catalog**:
   - Open `Assets.xcassets` → `AppIcon`
   - Ensure the "iPhone App 60pt @2x" slot is filled
   - Verify it shows a 120x120 icon

2. **Manual Icon Addition**:
   - Drag `AppIcon-60x60@2x.png` directly to the "60pt @2x" slot
   - Ensure it's recognized as 120x120 pixels

3. **Info.plist Check**:
   - Verify `CFBundleIcons` entries (usually auto-generated)
   - Ensure no conflicting icon references

4. **Clean Derived Data**:
   - Xcode → Preferences → Locations → Derived Data
   - Click arrow and delete the folder
   - Rebuild the project
