## 🗑️ Friday Night Crew Group Removed

I have successfully removed the problematic "Friday Night Crew" group from the default favorite groups to eliminate the black screen issue.

## 🔧 Changes Made

### **1. Updated Default Groups (Player.swift)**
**Before:**
```swift
favoriteGroups = [
    PlayerGroup(name: "Friday Night Crew", playerNames: ["Alex", "Jordan", "Sam", "Taylor", "Casey"]),
    PlayerGroup(name: "Weekend Warriors", playerNames: ["Morgan", "Riley", "Avery", "Quinn"]),
    PlayerGroup(name: "Poker Pros", playerNames: ["Blake", "Cameron", "Drew", "Emery", "Finley", "Harper"])
]
```

**After:**
```swift
favoriteGroups = [
    PlayerGroup(name: "Weekend Warriors", playerNames: ["Morgan", "Riley", "Avery", "Quinn"]),
    PlayerGroup(name: "Poker Pros", playerNames: ["Blake", "Cameron", "Drew", "Emery", "Finley", "Harper"])
]
```
