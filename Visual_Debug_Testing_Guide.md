# Visual Debug Testing Guide - Friday Night Crew

## 🔍 No Console Logs? No Problem!

Since you're not seeing console logs, I've added **visual debugging** to help identify the Friday Night Crew issue.

## 🎯 Visual Debug Features Added

### **1. Enhanced Selection Banner**
The green banner now shows:
- ✅ **Group name**: "Selected Group: Friday Night Crew"
- ✅ **Player count**: "5 players loaded" (should show actual count)
- ✅ **Player names**: "Players: Alex, Jordan, Sam, Taylor, Casey"

### **2. GamePlayView Fallback**
If no players are loaded, GamePlayView will show:
- 👥 **Icon**: Person group icon
- 📝 **Message**: "No Players Loaded"
- 🔙 **Button**: "Go Back" to return to setup

### **3. Duplicate Load Prevention**
- **Smart loading**: Won't load same group multiple times
