# ChipTally Test Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the ChipTally credit management app to ensure quality and reliability for App Store submission.

## Test Coverage

### 1. Unit Tests (chiptallyTests)

#### GameManager Tests (`chiptallyTests.swift`)
- ✅ GameManager initialization with default values
- ✅ Total pot credits calculation
- ✅ Credits per buy-in calculation  
- ✅ Player generation and management
- ✅ Player addition and removal
- ✅ Player name, buy-ins, credits, and score updates
- ✅ Game reset functionality
- ✅ New game with same settings functionality

#### Player Model Tests (`PlayerTests.swift`)
- ✅ Player initialization with default and custom values
- ✅ Player unique ID generation
- ✅ Player Codable compliance (JSON encoding/decoding)
- ✅ Player Identifiable compliance

#### Game Logic Tests (`GameLogicTests.swift`)
- ✅ Credits per player calculation
- ✅ Game setup validation
- ✅ Multiple buy-ins calculation
- ✅ Game end validation (matching totals)
- ✅ Game end validation (mismatched totals)
- ✅ Player ranking by credits
- ✅ Profit/loss calculation
- ✅ Edge cases (zero credits, large numbers, empty players)

#### Performance Tests (`PerformanceTests.swift`)
- ✅ GameManager performance with large operations
- ✅ Large player set performance
- ✅ Memory usage and leak prevention
- ✅ Concurrent access safety
- ✅ Data persistence performance
- ✅ Calculation performance

#### Validation Tests (`ValidationTests.swift`)
- ✅ Game end credit validation
- ✅ Player count validation (min/max limits)
- ✅ Credit validation (zero, negative, large values)
- ✅ Buy-in validation
- ✅ Name validation (empty, long, special characters, unicode)
- ✅ Score validation (positive, negative, zero, large)
- ✅ Data consistency validation
- ✅ Player removal validation
- ✅ Floating point precision handling

### 2. UI Tests (chiptallyUITests)

#### App Flow Tests (`AppFlowUITests.swift`)
- ✅ App launch verification
- ✅ Game setup flow
- ✅ Start game flow
- ✅ Game play flow
- ✅ End game flow
- ✅ Complete navigation flow
- ✅ Accessibility testing
- ✅ Complete game flow from start to finish

#### Original UI Tests (`chiptallyUITests.swift`)
- ✅ Launch performance testing

## Test Execution

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all unit tests
xcodebuild test -scheme chiptally -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15'

# Run UI tests
xcodebuild test -scheme chiptally -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15' -only-testing:chiptallyUITests

# Run specific test suite
xcodebuild test -scheme chiptally -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15' -only-testing:chiptallyTests/GameLogicTests
```

### Test Results Expected
- ✅ All unit tests should pass (100% success rate)
- ✅ All UI tests should pass (100% success rate)
- ✅ No memory leaks detected
- ✅ Performance benchmarks met
- ✅ All edge cases handled gracefully
